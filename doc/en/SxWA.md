## Sealed x WhatsApp

To send an encrypted photo with Sealed via WhatsApp you must send it as a document and not just as any image.

To start we select send an attachment and document:

<p align="center"><a href="https://alejandrogp.com/sealed"><img hspace="15" src="../img/sxwa_1.png?raw=true"></a></p>

Then we choose the image to send:

<p align="center"><a href="https://alejandrogp.com/sealed"><img hspace="15" width="400" src="../img/sxwa_2.png?raw=true"></a></p>

We send the file:

<p align="center"><a href="https://alejandrogp.com/sealed"><img hspace="15" src="../img/sxwa_3.png?raw=true"></a></p>

Once this is done, the other person will be able to decrypt that same image on the platform.

But ... Why should we do it this way and not as if it were just any image? Because WhatsApp compresses the image, which, simply put, means that our secret is lost.
